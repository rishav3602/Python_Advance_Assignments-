1. What are the new features added in Python 3.8 version?
Ans- Python 3.8, released in October 2019, introduced several new features and enhancements. Some of the notable additions in Python 3.8 include:
Assignment Expressions (also known as the "Walrus Operator"): It allows you to assign values to variables as part of an expression using the := operator.

Positional-only Parameters: Function parameters can be marked as positional-only, meaning they can only be passed by position and not by keyword.

f-strings now support the = specifier for easier debugging by displaying the variable name and value.

The math.prod() function was introduced to calculate the product of all elements in an iterable.

Syntax Warning now includes a suggested fix when using a colon (":") to define a variable annotation outside of a function or class.

2. What is monkey patching in Python?
Ans- Monkey patching refers to the dynamic modification of a class or module at runtime. It involves adding, modifying, or replacing attributes or methods of an existing object or module. Monkey patching allows you to extend or modify the behavior of existing code without directly changing its source code.
In Python, monkey patching is possible due to the language's dynamic nature. You can add new methods, modify existing methods, or even change attributes of an object or class during runtime. Monkey patching can be useful in situations where modifying the original source code is not feasible or desired.

However, monkey patching should be used with caution as it can make code harder to understand, maintain, and debug. It is generally recommended to use monkey patching sparingly and only when there is a clear need for it.

3. What is the difference between a shallow copy and deep copy?
Ans- In Python, a shallow copy and a deep copy are two different ways to create copies of objects or data structures:
Shallow Copy: A shallow copy creates a new object or data structure but references the same elements as the original. Changes made to the elements in the copy will also be reflected in the original, and vice versa. In other words, a shallow copy copies the references to the objects, not the objects themselves.

Deep Copy: A deep copy creates a new object or data structure and recursively copies all the elements within it. The copy and the original are independent, and modifications made to one will not affect the other. In a deep copy, each object is copied, including all the objects it refers to, and so on, recursively.

4. What is the maximum possible length of an identifier?
Ans- In Python, there is no hard-coded limit on the maximum length of an identifier. The length of an identifier can vary based on the implementation and platform constraints. However, it is good practice to keep identifiers reasonably short and meaningful for code readability.

5. What is generator comprehension?
Ans- Generator comprehension, also known as generator expression, is a concise way to create a generator object in Python. It is similar to list comprehension but returns a generator instead of a list. Generator comprehensions allow you to generate values on-the-fly, which can be more memory-efficient and time-efficient when working with large datasets or when you don't need to store the entire sequence in memory.

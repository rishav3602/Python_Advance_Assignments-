"""
Q1. What is the purpose of the try statement?

Ans- 1. The purpose of the try statement is to define a block of code in which exceptions might occur. By enclosing potentially error-prone code within a try block, you can catch and handle exceptions, allowing the program to gracefully recover from errors and continue execution without terminating abruptly.

Q2. What are the two most popular try statement variations?

Ans- 2. The two most popular try statement variations are:

try-except: This variation allows you to catch and handle specific exceptions that may occur within the try block. You can specify one or more except blocks after the try block, where each except block handles a particular type of exception. If an exception occurs within the try block that matches the specified exception type, the corresponding except block is executed.

Q3. What is the purpose of the raise statement?

Ans- 3. The purpose of the raise statement is to explicitly raise an exception within a Python script or program. By using the raise statement, you can generate an exception at a specific point in your code, signaling exceptional conditions or errors. The raise statement allows you to specify the type of exception to be raised, along with an optional error message or additional information.


Q4. What does the assert statement do, and what other statement is it like?

Ans- 4. The assert statement is used for debugging and testing purposes. It verifies that a specified condition is true, and if not, it raises an AssertionError exception. The assert statement helps identify logical errors or unexpected conditions during development.

The assert statement is similar to the if statement, as it performs a conditional check. However, unlike the if statement, the assert statement is primarily used for self-checking and debugging purposes, rather than general program flow control.


Q5. What is the purpose of the with/as argument, and what other statement is it like?

Ans- 5. The with/as argument is used in the context of context managers in Python. It provides a way to manage resources and ensure their proper acquisition and release. The with statement is used in conjunction with a context manager, and the as keyword allows you to assign the context manager to a variable for convenient use within the block.

The with/as statement is similar to the try/finally statement in terms of resource management. It ensures that any setup or initialization code is executed before the block starts and that the necessary cleanup or termination code is executed when the block ends, regardless of whether an exception occurs or not.
